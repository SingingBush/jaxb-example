JAXB Example
============

[![Maven](https://github.com/SingingBush/jaxb-example/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SingingBush/jaxb-example/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

This is an example of how to use JAXB with modern Java (11 and above) with JPMS. It'll build and run with Java 11, 17, or 21 using jaxb-maven-plugin for code generation with an example xsd found on https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_example.asp

# Build the application

```
mvn package
```
